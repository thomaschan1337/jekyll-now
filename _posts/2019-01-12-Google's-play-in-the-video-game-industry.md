title: Google's play in the video game industry
---

Google recently announced [Project Stream](https://www.blog.google/technology/developers/pushing-limits-streaming-technology/), Google’s newest platform combining streaming technology and video games. With their partnership with Ubisoft, testers of the platform can play Assassin’s Creed Odyssey with just Google Chrome and a steady internet connection.

Web-based SaaS delivery of video games would be a revolutionary breakthrough in the industry. Hardware limitations have been a legitimate plague to gamers. To play the newest AAA titles, you would either need to purchase a gaming console, namely Sony’s PlayStation or Microsoft’s Xbox, or spend an even higher amount on a PC.

Different players in the market are also working on their own video game streaming platforms. Sony has [PlayStation Now]( https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/explore/playstation-now/), NVIDIA is testing [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/geforce-now/), and even Microsoft announced [Project xCloud]( https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/08/project-xcloud-gaming-with-you-at-the-center/). Google’s position within the market is still unique. Google Chrome has the [largest browser market share worldwide](http://gs.statcounter.com/) and GCP is also one of the world’s best cloud service providers.

People are speculating that Amazon is developing their own alternative. I’d be shocked if it wasn’t already in development. Amazon has already made great strides in the gaming industry as well as the entertainment industry. In 2014, [Amazon acquired Twitch](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/amazon-buys-twitch-2014-8) for USD$970 million, a live streaming platform for gamers. On [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), you can watch gamers play your favourite video games. Almost every eSports tournament, big and small alike, is broadcasted on Twitch. You can even catch [Thursday Night Football](https://blog.twitch.tv/thursday-night-football-returns-to-twitch-32a850c5bee8) on Twitch. Amazon Prime Video is also becoming a great destination for streaming TV shows and movies. There is also no doubt that Amazon has the required cloud infrastructure and can leverage AWS.

How will this play out for NVIDIA and AMD? It turns out that [Project Stream will use AMD chips](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/09/googles-project-stream-cloud-gaming-will-use-amd-radeon-graphics/). For NVIDIA, I hope to see them continue to expand GeForce Now. At the same time, NVIDIA is already imbedded in GPU space and you can already leverage NVIDIA GPUs on major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.

I hope to see bigger developments in this space in 2019.
